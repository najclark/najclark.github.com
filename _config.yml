# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

intro: >
  I’m  an enthusiastic Computer Science student with an unwavering passion for science and technology. A self-motivated individual, with strong interpersonal skills along with theoretical and hands-on experiences that qualify me as a valuable asset in a Software Engineering Internship role.
  I have a tremendous work ethic, evidenced by my unique balance between rigorous academic studies, previous work experiences, hackathon competitions, and personal projects developed over the course of many years.


  Leveraging my problem-solving abilities, utilizing proficiencies in a variety of programming languages including Java, C, Python and others, I’ve successfully collaborated in developing various software solutions for both small and large organizations.
