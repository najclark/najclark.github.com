Throughout grade-school I competed in a variety of local and regionally recognized robotic and cyber security opportunities. While developing strong technical skills was a byproduct of my involvement, I also grew as an individual, with strong interpersonal skills, and a passion for working with others to solve challenging problems.\n\nMy high school years were a discovery period in which I began to explore the cross-sections of classroom theory and practical applications to solving real problems. Through after-school programs and college courses, I developed proficiencies in programming languages and began sharing my software skills with non-profit organizations serving my community.\n\nAs a college student, Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to be a part of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. The education, community, and opportunities available continue to serve my never-ending-thirst to continue growing towards a career in computer science. The culmination of my varied experiences have contributed towards establishing my voice and the person Iâ€™ve become, and as our campus mantra goes, â€œMy Heart Is in the Workâ€.\n", "contact-msg"=>"Academics consume a great part of my days.
