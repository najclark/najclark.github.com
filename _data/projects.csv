Early 2020,Bar Exam,https://sciencenode.org/supportedby/logo/sponsor-sdsc-logo.jpg,https://www.sdsc.edu/,"Designed as an entertainment application that challenges a user's ability to match musical lyrics with its original artist before time expires. The current state of the application allows the user to enter game mode and match lyrical selections from previously populated data models. In addition, the user has an option to contribute to the lyrical repository by imputing lyrics of their choosing. Results of the game are recorded and posted whenever the user fails to correctly match an artist with their lyrics. ","Project was developed to enhance my full stack experience using React.JS, JavaScript, CSS, MySQL database and API integration; as well as providing an entertaining experience to a user.",To Do...write info on some of the things or experiences that were developed / learned as a result of creating the project. You can also list some of the difficult challenges that you had to overcome to make it happen. You can also list some of the proposed enhancements that could further enhance the project.

The system permitted a user to view a decimal value [0-255] with their corresponding binary representation in both an automatic and manual mode. The overall user experience was simple, straight-forward and required little explanation. The device positively contributed to the learning experience of the students and greatly improved letter grades within the next exam cycle. Proving that the work I do can make a difference. ","This was an electro-mechanical device that utilized an Raspberry Pi micro-controller to process and display data. The electrical components consisted of a Shift Register circuit, 7-Segment Display, LED's [Light Emitting Diodes] and a battery power source. A wiring-harness and plexi-glass fixture were machined to provide a seamless integration and enhance the user's experience.",To Do…

Test4,CNC Milling Machine,https://cdn.greatnonprofits.org/images/logos/LeagueLogoFFINAL2.jpg,https://www.jointheleague.org/,"To provide my high school's Innovation laboratory with the ability to fabricate machined parts for education and faculty usage. I led a five member team charged with designing, building and implementing a solution capable of milling medium-density metal materials as large as 2FT x 2FT x 2FT. ","Implementing this solution required extensive research involving power requirements, machining, and environmental concerns. As a result, outside sources were consulted and provided mentorship in the execution of this project. Engineering drawings were created, parts and components were procured from a variety of sources [including overseas providers] and ...challenged with delivering a software solution that integrated CNC xxx code with xxxx to ensure that our solution operated efficiently on the X, Y and Z axes. An Arduino Microcontroller with a custom motor shield was selected to manage milling operation and communication activities.",To Do…
