Test,Bar Exam,/media/barexam/,https://www.sdsc.edu/,"Designed as an entertainment application, this program challenges a user's ability to match musical lyrics with its original artist before time expires. The current state of the application allows the user to enter game mode and match lyrical selections from previously populated data models. In addition, the user has an option to contribute to the lyrical repository by imputing lyrics of their choosing. Results of the game are recorded and posted whenever the user fails to correctly match an artist with their lyrics. ","This project was developed to enhance my full-stack experiences using React.JS, JavaScript, CSS, MySQL database, API integration, as well as providing a fun and entertaining experience to a user."
Test2,Binary Counter,/media/binary/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LoPJliyPfm_lQoKM8FG06eVhE96dpcwSNMgfkI9diWg/edit?usp=sharing,"In an effort to assist an AP Computer Science instructor in communicating the binary counting system, I manufactured a tool that counted and projected a visual representation. The system permitted a user to view a decimal value [0-255] with their corresponding binary representation in both an automatic and manual mode. The overall user experience was simple, straight-forward and required little explanation. The device positively contributed to the learning experience of the students and greatly improved letter grades within the next exam cycle. Proving that the work I do can make a difference. ","The Binary Counter allowed me to expand upon my experience of developing software code for embedded devices. The system was an electro-mechanical device that utilized a Raspberry Pi micro-controller to process and display data. The electrical components consisted of a Shift Register circuit, 7-Segment Display, LED's [Light Emitting Diodes] and a battery power source. A wiring-harness and plexi-glass fixture were machined to provide a seamless integration and enhance the user's experience."
Test3,Genetic Learning Library,/media/genetic/,https://www.jointheleague.org/,"The Genetic Learning Library was initially created in an attempt to better understand how a Neural Network by creating networks from scratch. Without the understanding of calculus at the time, I needed a different way to train each network that wouldn’t rely on calculus-heavy algorithms like Backpropagation. The solution I used was a Genetic Algorithm, which allows the Neural Networks to evolve generation by generation in a similar fashion to the way humans evolved over millions of years.","The final solution featured an abstracted Object-Oriented design, allowing for Genetic Algorithm to not only train Neural Networks, but also perform other varius Hill Climbing [Optimization] Machine Learning tasks. The library has been used in some of my smaller scale projects including an Algorithmic Stock Trader, and a Hill Climbing Picture Recreator. "
Test4,CNC Milling Machine,/media/cnc/,https://www.jointheleague.org/,"Invited by my school’s Innovation Laboratory, I was asked to lead a group of students through the design and development of a CNC Milling machine, to be used in a newly developed educational program. A five member team was assembled with rough specifications for a system capable of milling medium-density materials as large as 2ft x 2ft x 2ft in size.","Implementing this solution required extensive research involving power requirements, machining, and environmental concerns. As a result, outside sources were consulted and provided mentorship in the execution of this project. Engineering drawings were created, parts and components were procured from a variety of sources [including overseas providers]. I was challenged with delivering a software solution that integrated CNC g code with motor instructions to ensure that our solution operated efficiently on the X, Y and Z axes. An Arduino Microcontroller with a custom motor shield was selected to manage milling operation and communication activities. To account for the power supply, cooling system, computer integration systems, and allowance for milling materials, the overall dimension of the system consumed a 6ft x 6ft x 6ft area."
