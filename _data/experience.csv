Test,SD Supercomputer Center,Intern,https://sciencenode.org/supportedby/logo/sponsor-sdsc-logo.jpg,https://www.sdsc.edu/,"Assigned to a three person team, we were challenged with devising a software solution that would alleviate unnecessary bottleneck access to the Gordon Supercomputer network. Located on the campus of the University of California San Diego, delays associated with accessing this resource, limits important investigative research and experimentation from research scientists from around the world.","The team approach to resolving issues associated with the Support Ticket Response System, introduced me to the Software Development Life Cycle [SDLC] within an Agile Development environment. In the process of delivering code on a daily basis, I gained valuable insight into Continuous Integration / Continuous Development [CI/CD] as well as the importance of incorporating Unit Testing throughout the process. In addition, I gained invaluable insights into a variety of Machine Learning [ML] modeling as well as their applications. This area of technology is of particular interest as my college studies will continue to explore developments in these areas through classroom discussions and specialized research opportunities."
Test2,Eye Physicians Clinic,Intern,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTeWKeUO9pXyB7jBTxbaJqgZ1eIOao6iX4dz10f7RqKOMZxiQc5&usqp=CAU,google.com,Provided physician assistance and observations during eye surgical procedures. ,"This experience opened my eyes to the unique intersection between biological science, technology, and human interactions. I was fortunate to witness an end-user's complete confidence and reliability of an automated surgical piece of equipment during surgical procedures. On each occasion, my eyes opened wider to the realization of the many people, process and procedures that had to happen to make these experiences successful. Although this opportunity wasn't a hands-on software development experience, it has reassured my understanding that delivering reliable software solutions have consequences and contributes significantly to their overall user experience.

Test3,The League Of Amazing Programmers,Volunteer,https://cdn.greatnonprofits.org/images/logos/LeagueLogoFFINAL2.jpg,https://www.jointheleague.org/,"As a sixth grade student, participating in an after-hours Java programming curriculum with the Wintriss Technical Schools [now known as The League of Amazing Programmers], I excelled to an Oracle Certified Java Programmer level over the course of two years. As a result, I maintained a relationship with the organization as a Volunteer, and was assigned to support local non-profit organizations requiring technical support. Assigned to develop a software Inventory Management solution for the the San Diego Food Alliance, I designed and implemented a web-based food distribution application. The system proved to be critical in matching perishable food items with GIS [graphical information] with distribution centers most in need for those items.      ","Initially viewed as a cool inventory management system, I quickly realized how delicate and deprived many people are without the support from services like the San Diego Food Alliance. During the implementation of this solution, a Model-View-Controller scheme, Node.JS, Javascript, and CSS were used to build-out an intuitive user interface that was simple to use without the need for extensive training. For managing the back-end inventory storage requirements, a No-SQL MongoDB database was used. In addition to delivering this solution, I continued to provide additional support for an additional year where I performed bug fixes and new feature functionality when required. "
